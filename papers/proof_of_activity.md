## Summary

### Movitvation

* Bitcoin faces a number of attacks;
* Want to provide a new system resilient to attacks but still same guarantees or better;
* Need a more robust protcol;
* Security based proof combining both PoW and PoS;


### Problem

* PoW is vulnerable to attacks;
* DoS is possible, Bitcoin is resilient but it relies on honest miners staying.
* After mining block reward has been removed, there needs to be some security with transaction fees.
* Other PoS proposals are impractical or face security vulnerabilities.

### Contribution

* Proof of Activity (PoA), combining PoS and PoW with strong security guarantees.
* Discussion of vulnerabilities of PoW and PoA, solutions to problems.
* Analysis of the security and cost differences.
