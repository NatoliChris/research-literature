## Summary

### Motivation

* Blockchain is becoming increasingly popular, as both an aspect of society as well as in research.
* New algorithms are being implemented and used in different ways to traditional use.
* Consensus is difficult.

### Problem

* The consensus algorithms are not peer reviewed.
* Consensus is difficult, the algorithms are complex and they should be checked when implemented.
* All consensus algorithms should have formal proofs for showing that it has a superior gain.

### Contribution

* Paper offers a review of the consensus protocols offered by some of the blockchain systems.
* Provides overview of consensus protocols and properties.
* Summarised some of the permissioned blockchains and how they are defined.
